In this workshop, we have learned about Polymorphism and the templates of polymorphism which was quite interesting as well as hard
topic in the oop245.I faced a lot of difficulties in doing the lab as well as the milestone in milestone we have to do three different code 
in one file and the lab was a little tricky for which I refer to notes and some youtube videos to clear the concept of the polymorphism.
