In this workshop, we have learned about the usage of virtual functions with the inherited class which made us learn how we can
simplify our code by using them just by implementing them in the code we have also learned about the abstract classes which were 
part of the virtual functions. I found that this is a difficult topic for me it made me confuse every time whenever I tried to write 
the code but with help of class examples and the notes I was able to build my workshop and milestone 2 was very easy I didn't find any
difficulty in it all we have to do is create the functions which will print certain outputs.
