In this workshop, we have learned about the inheritance of the class and how we can inherit the class from another
 class and with the same similarities we can the parent class functions in the inherited class in this workshop 
we were instructed to make two files one was the vehicle basic which contains all the information about the vehicle
and another was the dumper which was inherited from the vehicle basics. The lab was similar to what the professor had
told and showed the example in the class while milestone was the complete revision of what I have learned till now I faced some
difficulties in milestones as well as in the lab for the syntax for which I referred to the notes provided by Seneca.
