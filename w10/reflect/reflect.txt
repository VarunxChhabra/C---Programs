In this workshop, we have learned about function templates and how to implement them in the code. With the use of templates, one can easily simplify the code Moreover, 
it acts as a blueprint for creating generic functions or classes. I face no difficulty in doing the code as all things were already mentioned and I practice a lot for
 templates as my professor told me in the class is the confirmed topic to come in finals. Talking about milestones recently i submitted my milestone 4 which took a lot
 of time as we are completing this semester so we need to submit all the big assignments at the same time I can feel the burden of it but I feel it's okay as gold shines
 more when it is heated more. However, I faced some conceptual difficulties in milestone 4 for which I referred to the notes.
