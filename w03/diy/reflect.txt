In this workshop, I have learned how to use a class and the use of the public and private members for creating and 
using the function basically this workshop helps me to get familiar with the classes. I faced some difficulties in
understanding the workshop for which I had joined the session by professor Fardad and also my friends help me in doing 
this workshop whenever I get stuck in creating the function they use to help me.
